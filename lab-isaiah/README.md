# Lab7 Docs:

####  All files & folders I added to this lab are under the folder lab-isaiah.

* Included the following required files and folders:
  * **README.md** (this file)
  * **.gitignore**
  * **.eslintrc**
  * **.eslintignore**
  * **lib/** (empty)
  * **__test__/** (contains <em>server.test.js</em>)
  * Also included **package.json** & **node_modules**

#### Completed Feature Tasks:
Created `server.js` and began to work on feature tasks. Spent some time distracted as I was trying to get cowsay to render a dragon or squirrel in the server upon GET req. Unable to accomplish the either one. Moved on to POST method but I'm calling it a night. Will attempt to touch again prior to class. Worse case, I'll resubmit. Tests need more work as they have only slightly been modified from todays demo. Will attempt to make more of an effort to TDD. Overall, really enjoyed this lab.
